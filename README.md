# ClinicPSI

ClinicPSI.WEB is the frontend part of the software made to help psychologists in scheduling appointments with their patients and controlling the patient records. Please note that the software is still under development and not yet finished. I have already implemented the user registration, user login and customer registration. Some technologies used in API: .NET 5, IdentityServer, EF Core, ReactJS, Redux, sagas, and Typescript.

This is the backend [ClinicPSI.API](https://github.com/ayslan/api-clinicpsi)
